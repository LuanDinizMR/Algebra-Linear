Exercise 1: ex1.py
This is a Python project which answers the following exercise:

Two bases, B = {v1, v2}, and C = {w1, w2}, are given for the vector space R2. So, there is a matrix P of the type 2 × 2 such that the vectors vB and vC, of the coordinates of a vector v with respect to bases B and C, respectively, are related by the equation vB = P vC. Express the coordinates (x1, y1) of a point with respect to base B in terms of its coordinates (x2, y2) with respect to base C.

Input: Base B = {v1, v2}, Base C = {w1, w2}, and Vector v.

Output: Matrix P and Vectors vB and vC.

Exercise 2: ex2.py
This is a Python project which answers the following exercise:

Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with them of the given 2 × 2 symmetric matrix A.

Input: Symmetric Matrix A, 2 × 2.

Output: If there are eigenvalues, if so, show: λ1 and λ2. And make explicit the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues.

Exercise 3: ex3.py
This is a Python project which answers the following exercise:

The graph of the given equation is a conic section that has been rotated. Identify it; of the rotation angle θ counterclockwise which gives a rotated system x1 y1 in which the graph is in canonical position; give the equation transformed into coordinates x1 y1.

Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 = F

Input: Values of A, B, C, and F.

Output: Conic identification, rotation angle θ, and equation transformed into coordinates x1 y1.
